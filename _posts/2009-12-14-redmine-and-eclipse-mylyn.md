eclipse mylyn has a nice connector for redmine. so, if you use both you should give it a try.  
the installation is quite simple.

**client side**  
use the update-site <http://redmin-mylyncon.sourceforge.net/update-site/nightly/>

**server side**  
download the plugin from [here][1]  
extract it into the redmine plugin directory and restart redmine.
