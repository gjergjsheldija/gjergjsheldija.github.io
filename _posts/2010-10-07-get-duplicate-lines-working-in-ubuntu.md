the default keyboard shortcut for duplicating lines (alt + ctrl + up/down) does not work. this is caused by the system using the same shortcuts to move to a virtual workspace above and below. go to system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts and assign a different key combo for the following two actions: switch to workspace up switch to workspace down duplicate lines works again.
