quick fix for a silly error i was having today with redmine not sending email anymore. 
openÂ config/environment.rb and add the following lines
{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
ActionMailer::Base::raise_delivery_errors = true
ActionMailer::Base::smtp_settings[:enable_starttls_auto] = false 
{% endcodeblock %}
it should solve the problem
