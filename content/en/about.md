  Hi! I’m Gjergj Sheldija, a Principal Software Architect 🏗️ and Interoperability Expert 💻 with 20+ years in HealthTech, now focused on bridging the gap between Cloud Native Engineering and Medical Regulation 🏥.<br/>  
  My journey started with Open Source. Years ago, I contributed to projects like Care2x, one of the first open-source Hospital Information Systems. That experience taught me a fundamental truth: **Healthcare software is useless if it stands alone.**<br/>  
  Over the last 20 years, I have evolved from writing code to orchestrating national-scale digital ecosystems.

passion_text: >-
  I'm passionate about **solving the interoperability crisis** in digital health 💊. At <a href="https://www.raylytic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Raylytic</strong></a>, I architected the **AIQNET ecosystem**, enabling **privacy-preserving AI** on clinical data while ensuring strict **MDR compliance** 🛡️. Previously at <a href="https://www.unicef.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>UNICEF</strong></a>, I led the **national digitization** of birth records across maternity hospitals in Albania 👶. My goal is to create **secure digital health ecosystems** that save lives by making data accessible and compliant.

  With **20+ years** in HealthTech 🏥 and **Cloud Engineering** ☁️, I bring a **unique perspective** to regulated software. I've led international teams in building everything from **national eHealth registries** to **high-traffic commercial platforms** (Trivago), always focusing on **security, compliance, and scalability** ⚡. My **polyglot background** drives me to bridge the gap between technical teams, legal counsel, and medical stakeholders.

  Outside work, I am deeply involved in the **Open Source community** 🌐, having contributed to projects like **Care2x** and **HAPI FHIR server**. I enjoy **mentoring developers** 👨‍🏫, exploring new **HealthTech standards**, and navigating the complexities of **European data privacy laws** 🇪🇺.

      While I believe architecture transcends tools, I am currently most   effective with:
      * **Languages:** Go (Golang), Java, Python, PHP.<br/>
      * **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Cloud Native patterns, Docker.<br/>
      * **The "Hard Stuff":** FHIR, HL7 v2/v3, DICOM, IHE Profiles.

    value: |
      -  **UNICEF**: Led the architectural design to digitize birth records across an entire nation, connecting maternity hospitals to central government registries.
      - **Raylytic**: Architected the AIQNET ecosystem, proving that AI and clinical data can coexist under strict MDR compliance.      
      - **Trivago**: Engineered high-traffic backend services that handle millions of requests, learning what true "web scale" looks like.

### My Philosophy: "Compliance as Code"

Many developers fear regulation. They see HL7 standards, GDPR, and MDR as roadblocks. I see them as architecture constraints that, when handled correctly, create robust, unshakeable systems.

I don't just "patch" compliance at the end. I design systems where compliance is baked into the infrastructure—using FHIR for data exchange and Event-Driven Microservices for auditability.

### The Toolkit

While I believe architecture transcends tools, I am currently most effective with:

*   **Languages:** Go (Golang), Java, Python, PHP (for legacy migration).
*   **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Cloud Native patterns, Docker.
*   **The "Hard Stuff":** FHIR, HL7 v2/v3, DICOM, IHE Profiles.

### Personal

I am a polyglot in both code and life. I speak English, German, Italian, and Albanian, which allows me to lead international teams effectively.

When I’m not mapping FHIR resources or optimizing K8s clusters, you can find me in Leipzig, likely reading about the next shift in HealthTech standards.

### Need to connect your platform to a hospital network?

Don't reinvent the wheel. I’ve already built the blueprint.
